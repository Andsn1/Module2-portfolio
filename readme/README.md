# Module2-portfolio

this is a read me file for the module challenge. 

In this challene one is requires to demonstrate some html knowledge and css knowledge at the required standard.A starter pack is provided which contains images, some html as well as a basic css sheet.

The key elements required within the html section is the production of a good html  file with all the necessary links provided and working.

The css document is required to add the styling element to the html to produce  viewer friently outcome. 

This assignment revieled to me that althought my html knowledge isnt adequate, my proficiency in it had a positive chance of increase. Due to the fact that the basics were gradually falling within the scope of my understanding.

This trend carried on with my experience of the css although more work is needed in that section.
